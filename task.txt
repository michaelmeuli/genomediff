Ciao Michael,
hope to find you well with this email ðŸ™‚

I have a task for you if you have time for the ACOMa project.

The task is to modify the .gd file (directory: /shares/sander.imm.uzh/MP/ACOMa/breseq/mab/$sample_id/data/annotated.gd) generated from breseq.

The modification of the .gd file (please find "annotated.gd" as an example attached) that are needed are the following:

Please remove all the lines that starts with # 
Add a sample_id column at the beginning that is populated with a variable, in this case is V0009. But I would need to make the modification in different files that have this directory /shares/sander.imm.uzh/MP/ACOMa/breseq/mab/$sample_id/data/annotated.txt where sample_id is a variable.
Consider the values as value separated by tab 
Values that are separated by comma belong to the same column (please preserved the comma) 
Some values are composed in this way: value1=value2. 
What I would like to do is construct a header that will have value1 and as the header value and then value2 as the value found in the corresponding row.
Note that not every row would have the same value1=value2 so different columns would need to be generated so no information is lost. As a consequence, for the row that value1 is not found there is gonna be an empty value in the corresponding row.
For the values that do not have a value1=value2 format, please add a genal header called for example column 1 column2.

My idea would be to generate from the .gd file a .txt file and then modify the .txt file. 
When all the .gd file are modified in a .txt file, then I would like to combine them all into one single file and filter out the synonymous variant that are found.

So far I have obtained this script ("modify_gd.py" please find it attached)  that is more or less working.

Please let me know if you have time and willingness to work on it ðŸ™‚ 

You should be able to have access to all the .gd file in the directory that I have shared, please let me know if that is not the case so we can find a solution. Also, do not hesitate to ask me more questions if you have any doubts or you need some clarification. 

All the best,
Meg
